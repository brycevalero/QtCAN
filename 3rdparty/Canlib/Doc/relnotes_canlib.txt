SDK Installation
========================================================================

Note that the CANLIB SDK should not be installed on top of an already
installed, older edition of CANLIB SDK. You should install into a new
directory, or uninstall the old version.

In contrast, the driver package may be installed over an old
installation of the drivers.

NOTE! If the Kvaser Eagle is reported as a "Kvaser Eagle Prototype",
you need to uninstall the old driver package and then reinstall the
new one.


Known Problems and Limitations
========================================================================
* Downgrading CANlib drivers from v5.21 and above, to v5.20 or lower must be
  done by first un-installing the current version, and then installing the
  wanted version.

* There is a limitation in kvadblib which requires the attribute definition
  enumeration members to be defined in a strictly increasing value order. If
  an attribute definition enumeration member is defined to have a value of x,
  all previously defined members with values greater than x are removed.



New Features and Fixed Problems in V5.23   (13-MAY-2018)
===========================================================================
* Fixed bug where LIN variants of canCHANNEL_IS_XXX lingered even after the
  channel later was opened as CAN

* SDK (kvmlib)
  - Fixed a bug in FIFO mode where partially overwritten logfiles containing a
    pretrigger sometimes got the wrong start date and could not be extracted.

* SDK (kvrlib)
  - A call to kvrConfigVerifyXml will now return kvrERR_XML_VALIDATION
    if the xml buffer don't complies with both the DTD and internal
    restrictions.
    Earlier it returned kvERR_GENERIC.

  - if a call to kvrConfigVerifyXml results in an error, kvrERR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL
    will be returned if the error message is too big for the given buffer.
    The buffer will contain the truncated error message.
    Earlier it returned kvERR_GENERIC.

* SDK (canlib)
  - A handle opened with flag canOPEN_NO_INIT_ACCESS will NOT go onbus
    until another handle on the same channel is onbus.

  - Cardinal's has been replaced with LongInt's in 'canlib.pas' to match DLL.
    This update affects functions: canReadSyncSpecific().

  - Integer has been replaced with Cardinal's in 'canlib.pas' to match DLL.
    This update affects functions: kvScriptStatus().

  - Cardinal's has been replaced with size_t's in 'canlib.pas' to match DLL.
    This update affects functions: canGetChannelData(), canGetBusStatistics(),
    kvAnnounceIdentity(), kvAnnounceIdentityEx(), canGetHandleData(),
    kvTimeDomainGetData(), kvReadDeviceCustomerData(),
    kvGetSupportedInterfaceInfo(), kvScriptGetText().

  - Added compiled script file (.txe) information retrieval function kvScriptTxeGetData.

  - canReadTimer is now obsolete. Use kvReadTimer or kvReadTimer64 instead.

  - 2 nodes can't have the same name. Function kvaDbSetNodeName will return -11
    (kvaDbErr_OnlyOneAllowed).

  - Functions kvaDbGetNextSignal and kvaDbGetFirstSignal now returns
    kvaDbErr_NoSignal if no signal is present. Earlier they returned
    kvaDbErr_NoMsg.

  - Fixed a bug which is triggered by assigning to a symbol defined by a CAN database.

* TRX
  - Improved error handling of not found files.

    status when appropriate. The device driver needs to be updated for
    this to work properly.

  of which (the one containing the driver files) is mandatory and the
  other are optional. We recommend that you use the default choices when
  installing the drivers.

* The driver installer supports a command-line switch /DISABLE=section[,section]
  which can be used to turn off installation of optional sections.

  run PcmciaIrqRouteToPciController.reg and lapcan_resource_filter.js.

* Fixed a bug where canReadSpecific would leave a "ghost message" in the
  queue. Further calls to canRead would return canERR_NOMSG but when
  reading the queue level, 1 would be returned.

* canlibCLSNET.dll: when using canIoCtl to get the EAN number, the DLL
  now returns an unsigned 64-bit integer that contains the EAN,
  BCD-coded in a hex string. Earlier version always returned an error
  code.

* filo_setparam_userdata.exe: Fixed hex number parsing bug for
  the -data argument.

* kcanl.sys: Fixed missing "break" that would cause the autotransmit
  buffers to misbehave if the user parameters were read.

======================================================================

* IMPORTANT for Kvaser Blackbird setup program: In this release
  changes were made that will require at least firmware 1.9.950. Older
  Blackbird firmware will not work. Also note that old configurations
  can not be read into the setup program. You must recreate the
  configurations.

* Kvaser Blackbird setup program: New channel selection user
  interface. The "automatic" choice is now replaced by "Search all
  channels".

* Kvaser Blackbird setup program: Added China as a regulatory domain.

  to canIOCTL_SET_TIMER_SCALE.  (#1693)

* (General) Fixed problem where the length of the outstanding transmit
  queue was incorrectly calculated, causing an overflow after sending
  more than 10240 messages without calling any other API than canWrite.
  (#1380)

* Support for OEM products 00527-3, 00536-5 and 00541-9.

* Compared to 4.0b, this release contains no changes visible to the
  end users - only changes to certain manufacturing software are made.



New Features and Fixed Problems in V4.0b (Release 27-MAY-2008)
======================================================================

* Kvaser BlackBird support: Fixed a problem with Kvaser Network Setup
  and the enumeration service (used for Kvaser BlackBird) where a
  registry key sometimes got a too restrictive protection.  This caused
  the Network Setup to fail updating the list of BlackBirds on the
  network and that would prohibit connections from the service to the
  BlackBird.

* Kvaser BlackBird support: Kvaser Network Setup will now issue an error
  message if the registry keys we just mentioned cannot be written.

* canlib32.dll: Added a missing DeleteCriticalSection when the DLL

* Fixed bug in canWaitForEvent that happened in 64-bit Windows only,
  although it was probably present also in Win32

* J2534 library: 1. Implemented timestamps for TxDone-indications. 2.
  Implemented ExtraDataIndex for all messages and indications. 3. Return
  correct value of read messages when reading fails.

* SDK: Added J1699/3 test application from Sourceforge; see
  samples/J1699 Added a fix in VerifyBatteryVoltage so it can handle the
  case when READ_VBATT isn't supported.

* Restored support for PCIcan/PCIcanx with Kone transceivers.



New Features and Fixed Problems in V4.0 (Release 2-FEB-2008)
======================================================================

* Kvaser Leaf, OEM versions: Fixed a BSOD in the driver when a certain
  third party software (for whiteboards) was installed on the same
  machine.

* SDK: Several small documentation improvements

* RP1210: Support for changing the baud rate on the ClientConnect call.

* RP1210: Added the ability to remove the "Serial=" in the DeviceParams
  line of a Device Block.  If a serial number is not provided in this
  line, the first channel that matches the hardware type and the
  required "Chan=" value is assigned to the device id.

* RP1210: Added the ability to define a baud rate on the DeviceParams
  line of the Device Block.  This allows legacy rp1210A code to use a
  baud rate other than 250.

* RP1210: Updated the INI file to have comments and match the latest
  RP1210B specification.

* For RP1210B please note: ReadDetailedVersion(), GetLastErrorMsg(),
  Set Broadcast List command are yet not supported

* J1587: The library functions j1587WriteMessageWait() and
  j1587ReadMessageWait() are rewritten to avoid losing incomming
  messages on a channel used for both reading and writing.

* The J1587 library has a new implementation that is more robust and
  should eliminate the certain timeout errors seen in the previous
  release.

* Corrected typo in INF files that could cause the PCI104 to get wrong
  driver when installed.
